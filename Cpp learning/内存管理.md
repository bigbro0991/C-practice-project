program translation 

The process of finding an address in the physical memory (physical address) and attaching it to the relocatable address in the absolute module (= logical address as in your text book) is referred to as binding. This binding takes place at load time.

A pair of base and limit registers define the logical address space

System maintains a queue of ready-to-run processes which have memory images on disk

Page tables may be kept in main memory

Two registers are used inside the MMU hardware to identify the page table: 

• Page-table base register (PTBR) points to the page table 

• Page-table length register (PTLR) indicates size of the page table

• In this scheme every data/instruction access requires two memory accesses

 • One for the page table and one for the data / instruction 

• The dual-memory-access problem can be solved by the use of a special fast-lookup hardware cache called associative memory or translation look-aside buffers (TLBs)



Memory protection implemented by associating protection bit with each frame to indicate if read-only or read-write access is allowed • Can also add more bits to indicate page execute-only, and so on
